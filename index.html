            <p> Released by the Gibson Guitar Corporation as part of its ES (Electric Spanish) series in 1958, it is neither fully hollow nor fully solid; instead, a solid maple wood block runs through the center of its body. 
                The side "wings" formed by the two "cutaways" into its upper bouts are hollow, and the top has two violin-style f-holes over the hollow chambers. Since its release, Gibson has released numerous variations of and other models based on the design of the ES-335. 
                Before 1952, Gibson produced only hollow-body guitars, which are prone to feedback when amplified loudly.
                 That year saw the introduction of their first solid-body, the Gibson Les Paul, a significantly different instrument from Les Paul's early electric guitar experiment, "The Log", which consisted of a center block with detachable chambers on both sides, a neck, hardware, and a pickup attached.
                 By 1958 Gibson was making a few solid-body models which had much lower feedback and better sustain but lacked the darker, warmer tone and unamplified volume of hollow bodies. 
                 The ES-335 was an attempt to find a middle ground: a warmer tone than a solid body produced with almost as little feedback.

            <h2>Gibson Trini Lopez</h2>
            <p>
                In August this year, Mexican-American guitar legend Trini Lopez – the man once hailed by Gibson as “probably the most exciting young star in the music business” – sadly passed away at the age of 83 after contracting COVID-19.
                Born Trinidad Lopez III and hailing from Texas, Trini formed his first band as a teenager and began his recording career in his early 20s.

            <p>    
                 Having eventually scored a residency at PJ’s nightclub in Los Angeles, he was promptly scouted by Frank Sinatra for his new label, Reprise Records. 
                The Top 10 debut live album Trini Lopez At PJ’s soon followed in ’63, spawning a smash hit single, If I Had a Hammer, and with Trini pictured on the LP cover cradling his beloved Gibson Barney Kessel Regular model, it wasn’t too long before Gibson began hammering on his door for a signature guitar of his own. Additionally, in order to capture some of the less traditional end of the market and capitalise on the success of the company’s double-cutaway thinline semis – a revolutionary design concept introduced in ’58 with release of the ES-335T – the Trini Lopez Standard was added to the line.

            <h2>Gibson ES-335 Premiere</h2>
            <p>
                The Gibson ES-335 Figured is the perfect blend of form and function. Crafted with a maple centerblock, players will be impressed by the lightweight feel and expanded range of tonal capabilities. Equipped with high-end appointments like the hand-wired control assembly with Orange Drop® capacitors, Gibson's new Calibrated T-Type humbucking pickups, Vintage Deluxe style tuners and light weight aluminum ABR-1 bridge and Stop Bar tailpiece anchored with steel thumb-wheels and studs. The AAA figured maple is set off by staggering gloss finishes including Sixties Cherry, Antique Natural, and Iced Tea.
                "The bracing is quarter-sawn thermally engineered Adirondack spruce, and we adhere the braces with hot hide glue and that helps to create a guitar that's acoustically louder, open, and with more clarity."
                Updated vintage appointments are more authentic than ever Gibson’s latest Custom Shop Reissue guitars include new appointments to add even more authenticity and vintage vibe to their guitars. Necks are now attached using hide glue, which many argue sounds better than synthetic glue. Gibson Memphis also re-engineered the truss rod, truss rod washer, and anchor to their original form. They eliminated the tubing that surrounded the truss rod.

            <h2>Gibson ES-335 Dot P-90</h2>
            <p>
                There are certain guitars that stand the test of time and with its timeless design, effortless playability and rich history, it's easy to see why the Gibson ES-335 remains such an iconic guitar. The Gibson 2019 Dot ES-335 P90 is a really great addition to this illustrious line. It features a gorgeous bound Rosewood fingerboard, embellished with pearloid dot inlays. With 22 frets and a 24.75" scale length it feels smooth and comfortable, equally at home playing slick lead work or heavy chord strumming.
                A pair of Memphis Historic Spec P90s it delivers those classic '60s tones, deep, rich and resonant but with a slightly different tonal flavour. Sitting somewhere between humbuckers and single coils, these pickups are boosted by the Memphis Tone Control wiring which allows for even greater tonal variation.
                The Gibson ES-335 Dot P-90 2019 Ebony combines the classic, since 1958 established semi-acoustic design with two powerful Single Coil pickups and turns out to be a versatile electric guitar for Blues, Rock and Jazz . While the body with the striking cutaway is made of three-layer maple-poplar laminate and reinforced by a solid centre block, the glued mahogany neck with the pleasantly rounded " Rounded C" profile lies perfectly in the hand. In addition, two powerful MHS P-90 pickups Gibson deliver a powerful and dynamic sound that is Overdrive convincing both in Clean and out of the box.
