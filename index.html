                Before 1952, Gibson produced only hollow-body guitars, which are prone to feedback when amplified loudly. That year saw the introduction of their first solid-body, the Gibson Les Paul, a significantly different instrument from Les Paul's early electric guitar experiment, "The Log", which consisted of a center block with detachable chambers on both sides,[6][7] a neck, hardware, and a pickup attached. By 1958 Gibson was making a few solid-body models which had much lower feedback and better sustain but lacked the darker, warmer tone and unamplified volume of hollow bodies. The ES-335 was an attempt to find a middle ground: a warmer tone than a solid body produced with almost as little feedback. Though semi-hollow-bodies like the ES-335 are essentially a compromise of earlier designs, they are for this reason extremely flexible, as evidenced by the ES-335's popularity in a wide range of music, including blues, jazz, and rock.
                The Gibson ES-335 is the world's first commercial semi-hollowbody electric guitar, sometimes known as semi-acoustic. Released by the Gibson Guitar Corporation as part of its ES (Electric Spanish) series in 1958, it is neither fully hollow nor fully solid; instead, a solid maple wood block runs through the center of its body. 
                The side "wings" formed by the two "cutaways" into its upper bouts are hollow, and the top has two violin-style f-holes over the hollow chambers. Since its release, Gibson has released numerous variations of and other models based on the design of the ES-335.

                 With a basic price of $267.50, it quickly became a best-seller, and has been in continuous production since 1958.

                The first major update came in mid 1962, with the most visible change being the neck markers: early models had dots (hence "dot neck"), later models had blocks.

            <h2>Gibson Trini Lopez</h2>
            <p>
                In August this year, Mexican-American guitar legend Trini Lopez – the man once hailed by Gibson as “probably the most exciting young star in the music business” – sadly passed away at the age of 83 after contracting COVID-19.
                Born Trinidad Lopez III and hailing from Texas, Trini formed his first band as a teenager and began his recording career in his early 20s.
                 Having eventually scored a residency at PJ’s nightclub in Los Angeles, he was promptly scouted by Frank Sinatra for his new label, Reprise Records. 
                The Top 10 debut live album Trini Lopez At PJ’s soon followed in ’63, spawning a smash hit single, If I Had a Hammer, and with Trini pictured on the LP cover cradling his beloved Gibson Barney Kessel Regular model, it wasn’t too long before Gibson began hammering on his door for a signature guitar of his own. Additionally, in order to capture some of the less traditional end of the market and capitalise on the success of the company’s double-cutaway thinline semis – a revolutionary design concept introduced in ’58 with release of the ES-335T – the Trini Lopez Standard was added to the line. 
                The very first samples of both models were shipped in late ’64, with production beginning in earnest the following year. With narrow diamond-shaped soundholes replacing the f-holes, a Firebird-style headstock with all the tuners on one side, and slashed-diamond inlays. In September 2007, Gibson introduced the DG-335, designed in collaboration with Dave Grohl, a variation on the Trini Lopez Gibson; the Grohl model has a stopbar tailpiece and Gibson's new Burstbucker humbuckers.[9] Other signature models have included the heavily customized Alvin Lee "Big Red" 335. A reissue of the 1963 model was a 2014 "Editor's pick" in Guitar Player magazine, at $4000.

            <h2>Gibson ES-335 Premiere</h2>
            <p>
                The Gibson ES-335 Figured is the perfect blend of form and function. Crafted with a maple centerblock, players will be impressed by the lightweight feel and expanded range of tonal capabilities.

The AAA figured maple is set off by staggering gloss finishes including Sixties Cherry, Antique Natural, and Iced Tea.
                "The bracing is quarter-sawn thermally engineered Adirondack spruce, and we adhere the braces with hot hide glue and that helps to create a guitar that's acoustically louder, open, and with more clarity."
                Updated vintage appointments are more authentic than ever Gibson’s latest Custom Shop Reissue guitars include new appointments to add even more authenticity and vintage vibe to their guitars. Necks are now attached using hide glue, which many argue sounds better than synthetic glue. Gibson Memphis also re-engineered the truss rod, truss rod washer, and anchor to their original form. They eliminated the tubing that surrounded the truss rod. New Kluson Green Key Tuners now feature proper vintage profile, color, and performance specifications. These features and others make the Gibson Memphis ES-335 Premiere Figured one of the most accurate reproductions ever.
                A semi-hollowbody that is true to the original The first ES-335s that rolled off the Gibson production line have truly achieved legendary status. The warmth of its semi-hollowbody design; the versatility of its two humbucking pickups – it’s a magical recipe that made the original ES-335s sought-after guitars among collectors who are often happy to pay astronomical prices for instruments in good condition. Odds of even finding a “block” ‘335 from the 1960s today are almost zero. The next best thing is to get your hands on this Gibson Memphis ES-335 Premiere Figured. It has the looks, the sound, and the star power of the real deal.
